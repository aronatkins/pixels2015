      <h1>Squaak?!</h1>
      <p>
        This is a rehash of <a href="http://gweep.net/~aron/">my</a>
        first-prize-winning from the
        2007 <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/400495/BarCampBoston2">BarcampBoston2</a>
        programming contest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original version was a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on
        Rails</a> application. The ASCII Tux-to-HTML rendering happened in
        Ruby. The audio was written
        using <a href="https://github.com/jimm/midilib">midilib</a> to a MIDI
        file in a known location on disk which was played through
        a <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ASCII <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">Tux</a> was
        generated with an image-to-ASCII converter and then cleaned up a bit
        by hand (exactly how is lost; maybe
        with <a href="https://csl.name/jp2a/">jp2a</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        That version did not render ASCII characters but used
        the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr search
        API</a> to find a set of images matching some user-provided search
        term. Data from the image URLs was distilled into a stream of notes
        for the MIDI file.
      </p>
      <p>
        This all worked great during the programming contest demo, but the
        MIDI file never felt right. All user searches would read and write to
        the same MIDI file, meaning Alice might play Bob's audio.
        We <em>MUST</em> make sure that every user receives the proper random
        audio!
      </p>
      <p>
        This version has no server-side component and is just an HTML page and
        a bit of Javascript. It uses
        the <a href="http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/">Web Audio
        API</a> to generate audio within the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not as pretty without all the Flickr images, but at least we have
        colored ASCII text, right?
      </p>
